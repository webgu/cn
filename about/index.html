<h3>About <a href="mailto:data_info_vision@163.com">Liu Song</a></h3>
<section style="font-family:calibri,微软雅黑,Times New Roman">
<p>Liu Song received his bachelor degree from Hunan Agricultural University majoring in Landscape Architecture. He didn't enter
 this high-paid industry but instead tried to pursuit a master degree after graduation due to his beliefs that liquors and cigarette 
 are not the elements body needs. </p>
 
<p>He then entered XTBG, Chinese Academy of Science, as a student of Ecological Evolutionary Group under the direct 
 guidance of Prof. Dr. Chuck Cannon. In the name of protecting from getting killed by toxic chemicals, he escaped the lab with white
 lab outfit and switched to forest policy researches, an area of social science.</p>
 
<p>At the group, he grows from a teenage to half a men mentally. And he views CHUCK as the mentor of his life (YES,that's 100 percent true. 
 my friend, his mentor is not staying in India like Jobs' one).</p>
 
<p>he worked in World Agroforestry Centre, East Asia Node, with a high level of satisfaction and fulfillment after graduation. But life changes, he drifted to Beijing, a population and mist powered city. Till today, he didn't 
 remember much words reading from philosophy books, but clearly has a good meomery on speech delivered by his Mentor:</p>
